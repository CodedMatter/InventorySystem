  Special Notes:
   
     - This project was made in a attempt to practice new Java concept im currently learning in Tech Elevator Java Cohort.
     - Here I practice:
      * Inherantance - I wanted to practice making classes that inherit from each other.
      * Unit Testing - I wanted to practice creating unit testing for my methods.
      * Organizing a Project - I wanted to learn a good way of organizing projects since I struggled to wrap my head around inheritance. I use Milanote for this.
